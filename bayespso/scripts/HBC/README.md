After the HBC_evaluation is finished:

First run
```bash
python private_public_evolution.py
```
This will create a specified output_dir

Then one can run 
```bash
python k_score_evaluation.py 
```

This produces the private and public scores for each of the iterations of the best score.

After this the plotting can be done.
